          <p>This document will describe the strategy, vision and direction of the Xubuntu project as well as act as a guide and a reference for the Xubuntu Team.</p>
          <p>This revised version has been written by Pasi Lallinaho with the help of Elizabeth Krumbach and Simon Steinbeiß along with numerous people in the community. This version is based on the former Xubuntu Strategy Document by Cody Somerville et al.</p>
          <p>We wish thank to Cody Somerville, Jono Bacon, Eero Tamminen, Nico Veenkamp and Lionel Le Folgoc for their contributions to this document. Some content, ideas, and inspiration were derived from existing Ubuntu documentation.</p>

          <p>Xubuntu is a community-developed, Ubuntu-based operating system that combines elegance and ease of use. Xubuntu provides a light, stable and configurable desktop environment with conservative workflows. Xubuntu delivers a polished and unified product ready for end-users.</p>
          <p>In addition to the technical aspects, the Xubuntu team focuses on contributor and user communities.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The target audience for Xubuntu consists of users who are interested in having an elegant, easy to use, polished and unified operating system. Xubuntu is a good option for those who want a stable, configurable and/or relatively light desktop environment too. Finally, Xubuntu is an appealing choice for users who prefer conservative workflows over the newest innovations.</p>
        <p>Xubuntu does not target users with specific skill sets or aptitudes. We want Xubuntu to be a viable option for users who are new to Linux or the Ubuntu platform, but also be appealing to more experienced users. Xubuntu does not specifically focus on new users or users migrating from Windows, but according to this ease of use, it is a good alternative for those users as well.</p>
        <p>Xubuntu does not explicitly target users with low, modest, or high powered machines but instead targets the entire spectrum. Xubuntu's extra responsiveness and speed, among other positive traits, can be appreciated by all users, regardless of their hardware.</p>
        <p>While Xubuntu uses Xfce, it is not specifically targeted to Xfce enthusiasts or projects and software being hosted by the Xfce project or associating (officially or unofficially) with Xfce are not guaranteed for inclusion in Xubuntu.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>This part of the strategy document provides a transparent framework and a set of priorities for the whole Xubuntu development and its tasks, including but not limited to decision making processes, package selection and technical dispute resolution.</p>
        <p>The areas of focus are presented in an abstract and simple form but are also concrete enough to be actionable. As the foundation of the Xubuntu vision, the specifications in the strategy document should not be confused with release-specific goals and priorities, but instead recognized as the principles which the release-specific goals are based on.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Usability is one of the most important parts of an operating system which is used on a daily basis. This is why Xubuntu should be easy to use and have an appearance that doesn't get in the way. The appearance should be an all-round experience, covering all user interfaces from booting to shutting down.</p>
          <p>Xubuntu should be localized to allow users to work in their preferred language. Another important aspect of usability is configurability. We believe Xfce gives users the possibility to configure their system in a meaningful way; other applications should live up to this expectation at least moderately well.</p>
          <p>While accessibility is not one of the main priorities of Xubuntu, it should be taken into serious consideration as long as it doesn't require unreasonable efforts to integrate, implement or maintain. At least common accessibility tools should be installed in the default Xubuntu installation.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>The Xubuntu team should strive to make Xubuntu lightweight. This means every Xubuntu release should work moderately well on machines that date to a few years before the release date. This ultimately means that newer Xubuntu releases may not able to support older computers. However, it assures that the Xubuntu team is able to work on other improvements and provide a release that is able to fulfill the expectations for a modern operating system.</p>
          <p>Users wanting the most lightweight system possible should be pointed at the minimal CD, more lightweight derivatives (such as Lubuntu) or other options.</p>
          <p>At the start of the release cycle, the minimum system requirements should be re-evaluated to determine if they continue to be realistic.</p>

          <p>It is important for us to provide a polished and unified product that is ready for end-users. It is also a prerequisite to enabling Xubuntu as a useful, usable and effective desktop. Without the mentioned integration, the Xubuntu desktop will appear rough and unpolished which is unappealing to end-users.</p>
          <p>The integration is accomplished also by selecting applications and libraries that work well with each other as well as by applying patches to assure a more bug-free system.</p>
          <p>See <a class="xref" href="xsd.html#xsd-seeds-composition-package-selection">Package Selection</a> for guidelines on how to determine if an application fits in the Xubuntu stack.</p>

          <p>The Xubuntu community is an important force in creating Xubuntu and making it as perfect as it can be. It's essential that regular coordination between contributors work well. The infrastructure to allow good communication between the contributors as well as users is described more closely in <a class="xref" href="xsd.html#xsd-community">Community</a> and <a class="xref" href="xsd.html#xsd-development">Development</a>.</p>
          <p>Where possible and appropriate, the Xubuntu team should work together with other communities, including other Ubuntu teams and upstream. If cooperation at a given time is not possible but would be beneficial for both parties, the Xubuntu team should try to allocate some resources to the cooperation at a later time.</p>

            <p>If at any time a majority of the Xubuntu team considers the actions of the council harmful for the project, the issue at hand should be raised to the council for reconsideration.

          <p>In addition to communicating with each other and the Xubuntu community, the Xubuntu team should communicate continuosly with other Ubuntu contributors, upstream and other projects related to Xubuntu.

        <p>The Xubuntu release cycle consists of 6 months from start to release, then an additional 9 month of maintenance for standard releases and 3 years of support for LTS releases. Although the Xubuntu project itself can not provide commercial support or commercial guarantees, the Xubuntu team will make every effort to conform with the acknowledged support period and provide security updates for Xubuntu packages.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>When considering the package selection for Xubuntu, there are two main guidelines:</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>The package must be in line with the mission statement</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>The package selection process must be conducted as objectively as possible</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>While the Xubuntu Technical Lead has the last word on package selection with the approval of the Xubuntu Council, it's recommended that the whole team is involved in the discussion, bringing up well thought out arguments both for and against. When appropriate, tests should be conducted to gather meaningful measurements.</p>
          <p>Before seeding an application in Xubuntu, the following aspects should be considered:</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>Usability and integration</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>Usefulness</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>Resource consumption and size</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>Reliability</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>Localisation</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>When measuring if a package is right for Xubuntu, the decision should not be based on an analysis of the package alone, but the target package along with its dependencies. Any package that is considered for seeding should fulfill the following requirements:</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>The package should use the GTK toolkit</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>The package should not pull in heavy libraries, especially if they will start frequently</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>The package should be well maintained upstream</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>The above guidelines can be omitted with the approval of the council when there are extensive benefits to seeding the package.</p>
